**KNOW THIS**

i allow inspo, NOT copying! (if your pony looks too similar to mine it will upset me, as every skin i make is a character belonging to me) // c+h always open, i will c+h those with it in their name // dni if you're over 19 or under 15 //

(dni in my terms means do not befriend me, im fine with c+h or regular convos)
